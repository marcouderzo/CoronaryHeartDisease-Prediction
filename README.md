## Context

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.

## Dataset Source

This dataset was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. The five datasets used for its curation are:

- Cleveland: 303 observations
- Hungarian: 294 observations
- Switzerland: 123 observations
- Long Beach VA: 200 observations
- Stalog (Heart) Data Set: 270 observations

- Total: 1190 observations
- Duplicated: 272 observations

- Final dataset: 918 observations

Every dataset used can be found under the Index of heart disease datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository at [this link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/)
